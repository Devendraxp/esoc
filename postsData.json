My children and I huddled in our small living room, praying that the walls would hold.\n\nOur local bakery closed last week. Now we rely on stale bread passed around by neighbors.\n\nElectricity is cut off most days. At night, we use candles, but I'm afraid of starting a fire.\n\nI saw my neighbor carry her wounded brother to the makeshift clinic. We all fear the next airstrike.\n\nI dream of peace, but each morning brings another threat.",
